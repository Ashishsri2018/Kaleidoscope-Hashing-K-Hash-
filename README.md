# Kaleidoscope-Hashing-K-Hash

## The Algorithm Explained
The algorithm takes a data stream (like a file or a block of text) as input and produces a
structured JSON or dictionary object as its output.
1. Pre-processing: Chunking
The input data is first divided into fixed-size, non-overlapping chunks. For example, a 1MB file
could be broken into 1024 chunks of 1KB each. Let's call the sequence of chunks
C=[c_1,c_2,...,c_n].
2. The "Lenses": Multi-Perspective Hashing
The algorithm then applies three different hashing strategies in parallel to the list of chunks. A
standard fast, non-cryptographic hash function, let's call it H(), is used internally (e.g., xxHash,
MurmurHash).
‚óè Lens 1: Positional Hashing
This lens captures the sequence and order of the data. It hashes each chunk
concatenated with its position (index). The result is an ordered list of hashes.
PositionalHashes=[H(c1‚à£1),H(c2‚à£2),...,H(cn‚à£n)]
This is sensitive to reordering, insertions, and deletions.
‚óè Lens 2: Frequency Hashing

This lens captures the "what" but not the "where." It ignores the position of chunks and
focuses on their content and frequency. It first computes the hash of each unique
chunk's content, then counts how many times each hash appears. The result is a map
(dictionary) from a chunk's hash to its frequency.
FrequencyHashes={H(cunique1):count1,H(cunique2):count2,...}
This is insensitive to reordering but sensitive to changes in the composition of the data.
‚óè Lens 3: Relational Hashing
This lens captures the local relationships between adjacent chunks. It creates a hash for
each overlapping pair of chunks (a bigram). The result is a list of hashes representing the
"flow" of the data.
RelationalHashes=[H(c1‚à£c2),H(c2‚à£c3),...,H(cn‚àí1‚à£cn)]
This is sensitive to local reordering but resilient to large-scale block movements. For
example, if a paragraph is moved from the beginning to the end of a document, most of
its internal relational hashes remain the same.
3. The Kaleidoscope Hash Object
The final output is a single object containing the results from all three lenses.
JSON
{
"chunk_size": 1024,
"total_chunks": 1024,
"positional_hashes": ["hash1", "hash2", ...],
"frequency_hashes": { "hashA": 15, "hashB": 4, ... },
"relational_hashes": ["hashX", "hashY", ...]
}
4. Comparison

To compare two files (File A and File B), you generate a K-Hash for each. Then, instead of a
simple true/false equality check, you calculate a similarity score for each lens:
‚óè Positional Similarity: The normalized Levenshtein distance or Jaccard similarity
between the two positional_hashes lists.
‚óè Frequency Similarity: The cosine similarity or a weighted difference between the two
frequency_hashes maps.
‚óè Relational Similarity: The Jaccard similarity between the two relational_hashes lists.
This gives a final, nuanced similarity report: "File A and B are 20% positionally similar, 95%
compositionally similar (frequency), and 85% relationally similar." This implies the same
content blocks exist but have been heavily reordered.
## Core Uniqueness
While it builds on existing concepts (chunking, hashing), Kaleidoscope Hashing is unique in its
combination and purpose:
1. Structured, Multi-Faceted Output: Unlike cryptographic hashes (one hash), fuzzy
hashes (one similarity score), or SimHash (one compact hash), K-Hash produces a
structured object with three distinct views of the data.
2. Characterization over Classification: Its primary goal is not just to say "similar" or "not
similar," but to characterize the nature of the similarity. This provides much richer
information.
3. Tunable Comparison: Users can weigh the importance of each lens for their specific
use case. For plagiarism detection, you might weigh relational and frequency similarity
highly. For strict version control, positional similarity is key.
A search for "multi-perspective data hashing," "relational and frequency hashing," or
"structured data fingerprinting" reveals no algorithm that combines these three specific
lenses into a single, composite object for nuanced similarity analysis. It differs from
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as it doesn't aim to reduce dimensionality but to enrich the
description of the data. It differs from ssdeep (fuzzy hash) by explicitly separating the
positional, frequency, and local-relational aspects of the data.
## Potential Applications üß¨

Advanced Plagiarism Detection: Can distinguish between a student who rephrased
ideas (low positional similarity, high frequency/relational similarity) and one who
copied-and-pasted (high similarity on all lenses).
‚óè Intelligent Version Control Systems: A git diff could use K-Hash to report "Function
blocks were moved but not modified" (low positional, high relational) vs. "Core logic was
rewritten" (low on all fronts).
‚óè Malware Family Analysis: Can identify malware variants that use the same functional
blocks but reorder them to evade simple signature-based detection.
‚óè Genetic Sequence Analysis: Could be adapted to find similarities in DNA sequences
based on gene order (positional), gene frequency (frequency), and gene adjacencies
(relational).
